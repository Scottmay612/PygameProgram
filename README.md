# Overview

For this program, my goal was to gain a solid foundation in pygame. I had never used pygame before and I learned a lot about its syntax and structure.

My game is a compilation of little things that I learned during this project. There are three screens. The first one generates ten randomly sized and colored rectangles. The user controls a small rectangle and can move it around to "collect" all of the rectangles. The left screen has spikes on that top that you are not supposed to run into. The right screen doesn't do anything because I didn't have time to build it out further.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

* I need to create classes for different objects. Right now, I have a lot of Rect objects but I would like to turn my triangles into objects as well.
* I need to make the arrows on the left screen fall from the sky and turn them into objects.
* I need to build out a mini-game for the right screen. It will probably be another game where you have to dodge the shapes as they move across the screen.
